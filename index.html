            <h1>NOTE</h1>
            <p>Dodger Color does not independently collect or share any data on the user other than the user’s unique device identifier. However, Dodger Color utilizes the third party SDK ‘Unity Ads’ which does collect and share all of the specified required data types listed below. Unity Ads does not process any data ephemerally. Unity Ads also encrypts all data in transit and does provide the option to request that the user’s data is deleted.
            </p>
            <p>Dodger Color only stores the following settings and variables attached to the user’s unique device identifier:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Highscore</li>

                <li>Enemy Speed</li>
                <li>Maximum Enemy Spawn Rate</li>
